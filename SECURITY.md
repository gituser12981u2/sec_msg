## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this project is of utmost importance. Because of this, if a security vulnerability is discovered, one should disclose it in a responsible manner.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:

For private reporting, please use [Security Advisory](https://github.com/gituser12981u2/sec_msg/security/advisories/new)

A response should be given within 48 hours. If a response eludes 48 hours, then please email a follow up email to ensure the original message was received.

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Policy

- A response to a report will happen within 48 hours with an evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date.
- If the instructions above are followed, no legal action will be filed against a reporter.
- Each report will be handled with strict confidentiality, and will not pass on any personal details to third parties
